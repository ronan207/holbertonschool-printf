# holbertonschool-printf

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

The printf function formats and prints a series of characters and values to the standard output stream stdout.
Format specifications, beginning with the percent sign (%), determine the output format for any list of arguments following the format string. The format string is a multi-byte character string beginning and ending with its initial offset state.
